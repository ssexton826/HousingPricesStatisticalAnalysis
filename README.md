<h1>Housing Prices - Statistical Analysis </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves analyzing factors that drive home prices in order to inform investment decisions in mortgage-backed securities. It involved examining and cleaning historical housing sales data from 2006-2010 using Excel. Research questions were defined and hypotheses were developed. Statistical tests, such as t-tests, were conducted to test hypotheses related to the impact of certain variables on home prices. The findings were presented to stakeholders that would indicate where they should allocate funds in mortgage backed securities.


<h2>Tools Used</h2>

- <b>Excel (t-test, complex functions, etc)</b>
