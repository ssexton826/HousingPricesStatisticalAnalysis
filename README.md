<h1>Housing Prices - Statistical Analysis </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The project focused on analyzing the determinants of home prices to guide investment decisions in mortgage-backed securities. Historical housing sales data from 2006 to 2010 was thoroughly examined and cleaned using Excel. Research questions were formulated, and corresponding hypotheses were developed. Statistical tests, including t-tests, were performed to assess the relationships between specific variables and home prices. The resulting findings were presented to stakeholders, providing valuable insights on optimal allocation of funds in mortgage-backed securities.


<h2>Tools Used</h2>
